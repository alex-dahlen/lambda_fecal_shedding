**Abstract**

COVID-19 manifests with respiratory, systemic, and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms.1,2 SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detected in respiratory and fecal samples, and recent reports indicate evidence of viral replication in both the lung and intestinal tissue.3â€“5 Although much is known about early fecal RNA shedding in individuals with moderate to severe COVID-19, little is known about the long term dynamics of fecal shedding, especially in those with mild COVID-19. Furthermore, most reports of fecal RNA shedding do not correlate these findings with GI symptoms.6 Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of the dynamics of fecal RNA shedding up to 10 months after COVID-19 diagnosis in 113 individuals with mild to moderate disease. SARS-CoV-2 RNA is detectable in fecal samples from 49.2% [95% Confidence interval = 38.2% - 60.3%] of participants within the first week after diagnosis. Whereas there was no evidence for ongoing oropharyngeal SARS-CoV-2 RNA shedding in subjects at and after 4 months, 12.7% [8.5% - 18.4%] of participants continued to shed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces at 4 months after diagnosis and 3.8% [2.0% - 7.3%] shed SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the feces at 7 months. Finally, we find that GI symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting) are associated with fecal shedding of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In conclusion, the extended presence of viral RNA in feces but not respiratory samples, along with the association of fecal viral RNA shedding with GI symptoms suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infects the GI tract, and that this infection can be prolonged in a subset of individuals with COVID-19.
